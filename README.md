PatternBolt
===========

Patternbolt is a fine selection of SVG pattern background, packed in a single CSS or SCSS file. Just put it in your project and add the right class to your elements. You can change pattern color changing the color variables and the pattern size changing the background-size. 
The pattern is added in a different level, so you can manipulate your DOM element as you want, adding a background picture, a gradient, or both. 
As they are vectors they never pixelate, not even on retina screens ;) 
The pattern selection still be under development and will be updated constantly. 

Contributions are welcome!
